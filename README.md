## What tasks were accomplished by team members:

#### Daniil Klyvniuk: 
1. Config prettier / esLint;
2. \**Refaction server for product
   variability;
3. Search products by autocomplete (backend part);
4. Saving images on server;
5. Product filter (backend part);

(**) Initially, we were given a ready-made server and it was planned that we would only do the front-end part. But 
our layout assumed product variability, which was not supported by that server. Now, the same product can have 
different variations in color, size, price, id and amount. Like 
[this one for example](https://fp-postil-bedding.herokuapp.com/product-details/61a653e8253d3605949967ec) - one product with different colors and productId.

This was my first experience with Node.js, noSQL database.
